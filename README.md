Personal Learnings:

It has been a stressful couple of weeks to start the program I'm starting to gain more confidence in my understanding of the different languages we are learning.

While I can look at the mobile view and say that I am satisfied with my work to date, I realize there comes a time when I need to ask for help.  Going forward when I run in to a roadblock I will do my best to step out of my comfort zone, and instead of shying away will reach out to my peers and instructors for help.
